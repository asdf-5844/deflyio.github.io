    <p>Defly io is a fun, multiplayer browser game where your goal is to fight other players and capture territory (based on the game mode), in the point of view of a helicopter. You die if you get hit by a single bullet or crash into a wall. To play, use AWSD to move around, lift click mouse to aim, and space or right click to build a tower. There is also a mobile version of the controls.</p>
