    <h1>Defuse</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Defuse is a fast game mode that incorporates a lot of dodging and speed.</li>
      <li>In Defuse, Blue tries to defend two bomb spots, A and B, as red tries to plant the bomb on one of them. Two teams of 8 players each. If red plants the bomb, blue needs to get on the bomb for 5 seconds to defuse it. If blue doesn't get to if after one minute, the countdown reaches and the bomb explodes. The right image shows a birds eye view of the first defuse map, but there are many more and anyone can make one using the Defuse Map Editor</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>1v1</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Where you challenge other players and have a 1v1 in the arena.</li>
      <li>This game mode takes a lot of practice to master, and improves multitasking (shooting while dodging) and hand-eye coordination.</li>
